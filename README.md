##The Sales Pitch

![enter image description here][1]

This userscript enhances the suggested edit queue to remove the usability annoyances we all know and <s>love</s> hate.

 - [Suggested Edits will **not** jump to the top when casting the deciding vote.][2] They fade out instead.
 - [Suggested Edits you've already voted on are hidden on successive page loads][3].
 - [Adds an "Ignore" option to an suggested edit.][4] Suggestions you've ignored are hidden on successive page loads.
 - [Additions and deletions in a title are mangled together and are hard to understand][7]. They're shown side by side.

Added bonus:

 - Suggested Edits which have already been voted on by another user are automatically listed first
 - Auto-updater built in, so you'll get new features automatically
 - Individual features can be toggled on and off via preferences shown at the bottom of the edit queue.
